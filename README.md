# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-for-HR-Insights
This project aims to analyze employee attrition data to identify key factors that contribute to employees leaving a company. Using data science techniques, we explore patterns in employee behavior, visualize trends, and build predictive models to help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and job satisfaction.
